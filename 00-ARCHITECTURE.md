# WarpDrive — Architecture Index

This file is an index. Detailed architecture documentation is split into
two files to clearly separate what exists from what is planned.

| Document | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| [ARCHITECTURE_CURRENT.md](ARCHITECTURE_CURRENT.md) | Implemented components, repo structure, interfaces, and config as they exist today |
| [ARCHITECTURE_PLANNED.md](ARCHITECTURE_PLANNED.md) | Roadmap items: gRPC, dashboard, Dockerfile, governance, write support, SFI compliance |
| [README.md](README.md) | Quickstart, prerequisites, build instructions, limitations |
| [DEMO.md](DEMO.md) | Guided walkthrough with sample data |
| [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) | Vulnerability reporting, secret handling, permissions |

For milestone-specific design notes, see `M1-CORE-MOUNT.md` through
`M5-INTEGRATION-HARDENING.md`.
